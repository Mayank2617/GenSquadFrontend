      { question: "Do your engineers have experience with production LLM and RAG systems, not just demos?", answer: "Yes. Many candidates have shipped real products such as enterprise copilots, knowledge assistants, RAG search, content automation tools, and GenAI features embedded in SaaS and internal systems, with experience in monitoring, evaluation, and iteration." },
      { question: "How fast can we start working with a Generative AI engineer or squad?", answer: "Most teams receive a curated shortlist of pre-vetted engineers within 48 hours. From there you can interview, select, and onboard talent quickly, so you see early PoCs and internal pilots in a matter of days or weeks." },
      { question: "Can GenSquad help if we're still exploring use cases or don't have clean data yet?", answer: "Yes. You can bring in AI Architects, Data Engineers, and LLM Engineers to run discovery workshops, perform data readiness audits, define PoCs, and design the initial architecture, even before you commit to full-scale development." },
      { question: "How do you handle safety, compliance, and IP protection for GenAI projects?", answer: "Engineers in the network are screened for experience with guardrails, access control, red-teaming, data minimization, and logging. They can help you set up policies and technical controls to keep prompts, context, and outputs aligned with your security and compliance requirements." },
      { question: "What if a GenAI hire isn't the right fit for our product or culture?", answer: "If a match doesn't work out, you can request a replacement. GenSquad will rematch you with alternative, pre-vetted candidates better aligned with your stack, domain, and way of working, typically without restarting the entire search from scratch." }

      { question: "Do you cover both classic ML and LLM/RAG systems?", answer: "Yes. Talent has experience testing supervised models (scoring, ranking, forecasting) and GenAI systems (LLMs, RAG, agents), with different metrics and methods appropriate to each." },
      { question: "How do you measure the quality of LLM and RAG outputs?", answer: "Engineers use golden datasets, rubric-based scoring, tools like RAG evaluation frameworks, human review interfaces, and online metrics (e.g., resolution rate, satisfaction) to quantify quality." },
      { question: "Can you integrate AI testing into our existing CI/CD pipeline?", answer: "Yes. AI QA and MLOps engineers wire automated tests and eval checks into your pipelines so new prompts, models, or configs must pass quality gates before deployment." },
      { question: "How do you handle safety and compliance concerns?", answer: "Safety and Policy Engineers define allowed/blocked behavior, add content filters and guardrails, run red-team exercises, and log decisions to support internal and regulatory reviews." },
      { question: "We already have QA-why do we need AI-specific QA?", answer: "Traditional QA covers deterministic behavior; AI systems are probabilistic and data-dependent. AI QA specialists bring eval design, dataset curation, and model-aware testing needed to reliably judge and improve AI behavior over time." }
